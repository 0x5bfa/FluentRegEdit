Registry Valley is the next generation Registry editor that replace Regedit.exe. In addition to all Regiedit's features, it supports dark theme, powerful WinUI with fluent controls, and custom color themes.

I will be happy if you'd like to contribute this project. We welcome complaints about the legacy app Regedit.exe and suggestions for newf features. Please file an issue if you have encountered any unexpected behaviors in GitHub Issues page.
